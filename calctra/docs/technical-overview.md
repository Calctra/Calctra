# Calctra Technical Overview

## Architecture Overview

Calctra is a decentralized platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a marketplace for scientific computing resources. The platform connects resource providers with users who need computational power, using smart contracts to manage transactions securely and efficiently.

### Core Components

1. **Backend API Service (Node.js)**
   - RESTful API for client interactions
   - User management and authentication
   - Resource management and matching
   - Job scheduling and monitoring
   - Data encryption and security

2. **Blockchain Integration (Solana)**
   - Smart contracts for resource matching
   - Token-based payment system
   - Decentralized identity verification
   - Transaction verification and history

3. **Data Layer (MongoDB)**
   - User profiles and preferences
   - Resource specifications and availability
   - Job history and status
   - Payment records and analytics

4. **Security Layer**
   - Homomorphic encryption for data privacy
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure data sharing protocols

## System Workflow

1. **Resource Registration**
   - Providers register their computing resources
   - Resources are verified and added to the resource pool
   - Smart contracts are created to manage availability

2. **Job Submission**
   - Users submit computational jobs with requirements
   - Data is encrypted using homomorphic encryption
   - Budget and timeline are specified

3. **Resource Matching**
   - The matching engine finds optimal resources
   - Pricing is calculated based on market dynamics
   - Smart contracts are prepared for execution

4. **Job Execution**
   - Resources are allocated to the job
   - Computation is performed on encrypted data
   - Progress is monitored and reported

5. **Result Delivery and Payment**
   - Results are delivered securely to the user
   - Tokens are transferred from user to provider
   - Transaction is recorded on the blockchain

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Solana, SPL Tokens
- **Security**: Homomorphic encryption, JWT
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data
- Smart contracts are audited for security vulnerabilities
- Multi-factor authentication for user accounts
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient resource matching algorithms
- Caching strategies for frequent queries
- Horizontal scaling for API services
- Optimized database queries and indexing
- Load balancing for high availability

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional blockchain networks
- Enhanced machine learning for resource matching
- Mobile application for monitoring jobs
- Specialized resource categories for specific scientific domains
- Reputation system for resource providers and users

## Development Roadmap

1. **Q2 2023**: Core platform architecture and blockchain integration
2. **Q3 2023**: Resource matching engine and homomorphic encryption implementation
3. **Q4 2023**: Beta testing with select scientific partners
4. **Q1 2024**: Public launch and token distribution
5. **Q2 2024**: Expansion to additional scientific computing domains

## API Structure

The Calctra API is organized around REST principles. It uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and accepts JSON request bodies.

### Main API Endpoints

- `/api/auth`: User authentication and authorization
- `/api/users`: User profile management
- `/api/resources`: Computing resource management
- `/api/jobs`: Computational job management
- `/api/data`: Encrypted data storage and sharing
- `/api/tokens`: CAL token transactions and history
